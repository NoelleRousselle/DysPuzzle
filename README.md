## Abstract
Dyslexia is a developmental disorder that affects the acquisition of reading and writing [1]. Studies show that there is a causal correlation between visual perception and the development of dyslexia [2]. Visual perception disorders can already be diagnosed at pre-school age and thus offer an approach to the early detection of dyslexia. For this reason, we propose a mobile application in the form of a jigsaw puzzle for Android smartphones to measure the game interaction of young players in the future. These measurements will be used in the future to distinguish between a player with or without dyslexia. As part of the pilot study, the user interface of the app was evaluated with children and their parents. The number of test participants is based on the five-user test by Nielsen [3] for each user group. The actions of the test participants were observed and recorded. The parents should also share their thoughts while using the device (thinking aloud method [4]). The usability test showed that the children had fun playing with the app. In addition, the children's difficulties in using the app were identified and discussed. The recording and storage of game data have been evaluated as well.
